# Carbone Docker
Embedded Carbone in a Docker image with simple REST API.

## How to consume exposed API ?
The simpliest way to use this image is to use `node` and install [`carbone-connect` package](https://npmjs.org/carbone-connect). If you need a Python wrapper you can follow to this [`repo py-carbone-connect`](https://github.com/Piuliss/py-carbone-connect), really easy to use and play.
